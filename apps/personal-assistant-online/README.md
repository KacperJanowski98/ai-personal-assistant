# LLMOps for Production-Ready Agentic RAG Systems (Online Module)

This project implements a production-focused Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, incorporating LLMOps best practices. The goal is to build robust, maintainable, and observable LLM-powered applications that can dynamically reason and retrieve information.

## Overview

Traditional RAG systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing external context, but they often follow a static workflow. Agentic RAG introduces a layer of intelligence where an "agent" (an LLM-powered reasoning engine) can dynamically decide when and how to retrieve information, and which tools to use to process a query. This adds flexibility and power but also introduces more randomness and complexity into the system.

This project addresses these challenges by implementing robust LLMOps practices, including comprehensive monitoring and evaluation pipelines, to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Key Concepts from "LLMOps for Agentic RAG"

*   **Agents vs. Workflows**:
    *   **Workflows**: Offer stability but can be rigid.
    *   **Agents**: Provide flexibility and dynamic decision-making at the cost of potential inconsistency and randomness. This project leverages agents for their adaptability.
*   **Agentic RAG**:
    *   The LLM agent dynamically chooses whether it needs external context and which tools to use (e.g., database query, summarization).
    *   This differs from standard RAG where the retrieval step is often a fixed part of the process.
*   **LLMOps for Agentic RAG**:
    *   Critical for managing the increased randomness and complexity introduced by agents.
    *   Focuses on making the system debuggable, maintainable, and its performance trackable.
    *   Includes prompt monitoring, RAG evaluation, and automated observability.

## System Architecture

1.  **Offline Processing (RAG Feature Pipeline)**:
    *   **Data Extraction**: Pulls raw documents (e.g., from MongoDB).
    *   **Preprocessing & Standardization**: Cleans and formats documents.
    *   **Document Exploration & Filtering**: Analyzes and removes low-value content.
    *   **Embedding & Storage**: Documents are chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas Vector Search) for efficient retrieval.
    *   **Summarization/Distillation**: Generation of summaries to enhance context quality.

2.  **Online Processing (Agentic RAG Module)**:
    *   **User Interface (CLI / Gradio)**: Allows users to interact with the system.
    *   **Agentic Layer**: An LLM-powered agent that receives user queries.
        *   **Reasoning & Tool Selection**: The agent dynamically determines the most suitable tool(s) to process the request. It decides if context retrieval is necessary.
        *   **Available Tools**:
            *   `what_can_i_do_tool`: Helps users understand the system's capabilities.
            *   `retriever_tool`: Queries the vector database for relevant context if the agent deems it necessary.
            *   `summarization_tool` (Optional): Refines retrieved data for clarity before final response generation.
    *   **Response Generation**: The agent uses the selected tools and retrieved context (if any) to generate a response to the user.

3.  **LLMOps Observability Pipelines**:
    *   **Prompt Monitoring Pipeline**:
        *   Captures entire prompt traces, including templates and models used.
        *   Logs input/output, latency, and other metadata.
        *   Provides structured insights through dashboards for detecting and resolving inefficiencies.
    *   **RAG Evaluation Pipeline**:
        *   Tests the Agentic RAG module using heuristics and LLM judges.
        *   **Metrics Tracked**:
            *   Moderation (appropriateness of response).
            *   Hallucination (factual consistency).
            *   Answer Relevance (how well the response addresses the query).
            *   Context Precision & Recall (for RAG specifically).
            *   Custom Metrics (e.g., assessing output length and density).
        *   Can run as an offline batch pipeline during development and for continuous monitoring.

## Core Functionalities

*   **Dynamic Reasoning**: The agent intelligently decides the steps needed to answer a query.
*   **Tool Usage**: The agent can leverage multiple tools (e.g., vector search, summarizers).
*   **Real-time Interaction**: Designed to respond to user queries instantly.
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks system behavior, performance, and data quality.
*   **Automated Evaluation**: Continuously assesses the quality and reliability of the RAG system.

## Challenges in Productionizing Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG systems, while powerful, present unique challenges:

*   **Increased Randomness**: Agents introduce more variability compared to static workflows.
*   **Scalability & Latency**: Handling complex queries and large datasets efficiently.
*   **Evaluation Complexity**: Assessing the performance of dynamic, multi-step reasoning is harder.
*   **Cost Management**: Multiple LLM calls or tool invocations can increase operational costs.
*   **Debugging**: Tracing issues through an agent's decision-making process can be complex.
*   **Data Quality**: Reliance on high-quality, relevant data in the vector store is crucial.
*   **Ethical Concerns**: Data protection, transparency, and accountability need careful consideration.
