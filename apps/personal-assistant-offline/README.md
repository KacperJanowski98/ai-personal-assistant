## Installation

To install the dependencies and activate the virtual environment, run the following commands:

```bash
uv venv .venv-offline
. ./.venv-offline/bin/activate # or source ./.venv-offline/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

We use [Crew4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) for crawling. To finish setting it up you have to run some post-installation setup commands (more on why this is needed in their [docs](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)):
```bash
# Run post-installation setup
uv pip install -U "crawl4ai==0.4.247" # We have to upgrade crawl4ai to support these CLI commands (we couldn't add it to pyproject.toml due to ZenML version incompatibility with Pydantic).
crawl4ai-setup

# Verify your installation
crawl4ai-doctor
```

## Environment Configuration

You have to set up your environment:
1. Create your environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open `.env` and configure the required credentials
